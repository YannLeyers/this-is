            <div class="subtitle">Tags or Tagging</div>
            Tagging is the simplest and most recognized style of graffiti. A tag is essentially the artist’s
            “signature” using a pseudonym.<br>
            <br>

            <div class="subtitle">Throw-Ups</div>
            A throw-up is another form of tagging. It is usually a more significant size that is more sophisticated
            and may use more paints and colors.<br>
            <br>

            <div class="subtitle">Blockbuster</div>
            A blockbuster goes up one more level of sophistication from a throw up. It is much bigger and often
            fills up an entire space, such as a wall.<br>
            <br>

            <div class="subtitle">Wildstyle</div>
            Wildstyle graffiti is also text-based, but it uses elaborate font styles that can be difficult to read.
            The legibility doesn’t make wildstyle graffiti unappealing; it is generally perceived as one of the most
            visually attractive tagging styles.<br>
            <br>
            Complicated and interlocked letters, spikes, arrows, and other decorative elements are incorporated into
            this complex artwork.<br>
            <br>

            <div class="subtitle">Heaven or Heaven Spot</div>
            Heaven or the heaven-spot refers to graffiti art in hard-to-reach places. These artworks are typically
            found very high up on buildings that are very difficult to get to, bridges, roofs, etc.<br>
            <br>

            <div class="subtitle">Stencil</div>
            Stencils are shapes made of cardboard, paper, metal, plastic, or other materials. An artist will then
            spray against the stencil to create an image or text.<br>
            <br>
            Stencil graffiti has become incredibly popular. The artist known as “Banksy” has utilized the stencil
            style and brought it into the mainstream.<br>
            <br>

            <div class="subtitle">Poster or Paste-Up</div>
            Posters or paste-ups are a quick and easy way to put up pieces. These artists will create their artwork
            at home and then paste it up on walls and other public places.<br>
            <br>
            Unlike commercial posters, this artwork gets put up without permission, which classifies it as graffiti
            art.<br>
            <br>

            <div class="subtitle">Sticker or Slap</div>
            Stickers are smaller than posters and do not require paste. Some stickers are simply tags drawn onto
            sticky labels, while other more sophisticated stickers are created using computer graphics and are more
            elaborate.<br>
            <br>
            Stickers are not created “in the field.”<br>
            <br>

            <div class="subtitle">Piece</div>
            A ‘piece is a graffiti picture that has been painted freehand. The name, as you may have guessed, is
            short for a masterpiece.<br>
            <br>
            These artworks contain at least three colors and usually take longer to paint than a tag. A ‘piece will
            often reach a level of public acceptability that most graffiti does not achieve.<br>
            <br>
            A ‘piece created in an obvious place will gain respect from both the public and other artists.
            It may be perceived as street art, assumed to have been painted with permission.<br>
            <br>

            <div class="subtitle">3D Graffiti</div>
            3D graffiti creates an elaborate illusion and is also well perceived by the public. 3D graffiti pieces
            are usually visual scenes that create the illusion of a third dimension.<br>
            <br>
            3D graffiti may cover multiple walls or spread out onto pavements and roads.<br>
            <br>
