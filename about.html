            <p>Because the law considers graffiti vandalism, most graffiti artists, or “writers,” use a tagger name or a
                pseudonym. Anonymity and not getting caught are key. The risk and challenge of tagging high-profile or
                hard to reach places is also a part of graffiti’s appeal.<br>
                <br>

                Most well-known graffiti styles are text-based, but the scene has expanded to include images, mixed
                media, and even 3D art forms.<br>
                <br>

                There is an overlap with street art, and many artists cross over between the two styles. However,
                graffiti is a distinct art form with its unique styles and culture.<br>
                <br>

            <div class="subtitle">History</div>
            People have been writing and painting on rocks and walls throughout human history. As far back as the
            Stone Age, people created cave paintings. In Europe, drawings and carvings on walls have been created
            for over 40 000 years. Wall paintings from ancient times often had a magical or religious significance.<br>
            <br>

            Modern graffiti art originated in the mid-1960s in Philadelphia. A competition emerged in the city's
            subcultures to see who could write their name with a marker in as many places as possible.<br>
            <br>

            In the early days of modern graffiti, taggers were associated with crime and violent street culture.
            Later in the 1970s, graffiti was common among gangs which created a bad reputation.<br>
